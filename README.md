# learningJournal

Heyya,

This section is just to make a little journal which follows my journey in learning front-end development.
This was initially meant to only be a solo project as part of the course on Scrimba, however I've decided to take this further and create a full portfolio site from this instead.

This won't be a one and done thing either as I plan on updating this regularly, not only with articles showing what I've learned but with improvements to the actual site as I progress.
